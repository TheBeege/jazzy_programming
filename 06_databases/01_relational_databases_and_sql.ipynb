    "# Relational Databases and SQL\n",
    "Relational databases are arguably the most popular database system in use today. They allow you to have disparate data that's relatable to each other with minimal duplicate data and accessible at high speeds. SQL, or structured query language, is the most common interface language for relational database systems. Here, we'll cover concepts in relational databases and use a simple development databases called SQLite3. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Structure of a Relational Database\n",
    "Relational databases have several ways of grouping data. Within a database server or cluster of servers, there's often the concept of a schema, sometimes also called a database. A schema, at a high level, is a way to group different types of data, either logically or according to some technical requirements like storage location or character set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within a schema, you then have tables. Tables is where all of the magic happens. Similar to CSV files, tables have the concept of rows and columns. Rows are also called records. Columns are also called fields, and they must be defined when you define the table. Fields can be altered, but doing this can make life miserable very quickly. It's worth putting up-front thought into table design to save yourself pain later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each field within a table must have a name and data type. Data types can be things like integer, varchar (variable character, or basically, limited text), boolean, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each table must have a primary key. A primary key determines the order in which data is stored in the table and serves as the identifier for a given row. This primary key is often just a selected field, though you can also have composite primary keys, consisting of multiple fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Tables\n",
    "Let's check out a table definition:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table person (\n",
    "    id int auto_increment,\n",
    "    name varchar(255),\n",
    "    is_admin boolean,\n",
    "    primary key (id)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that this is a MySQL dialect of SQL. ANSI SQL's (standard SQL) more recent updates deviate from this, since the updates were made after several database systems were already well established. When trying out a new database system, make sure to check the syntax for various features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will create a table called `person`. It will have 3 columns. The first will be called `id` and will store `integer` data. It will increase by 1 each time a new record is created, assuming it isn't specified. It also has a `name` field which can be up to 255 characters long for latin characters. Other text in utf-8 may require more space, so you should plan accordingly depending on the size of the text you'll be storing. The `is_admin` column is a booleam (true/false) column. Lastly, the `id` field will be the primary key. When storing data, the database will store it according to the `id` column. Each `id` _must_ be unique. Attempting to create a new record with a duplicate `id` will give you an error. In a table like this, you'll want to omit the `id` when creating a new record and let the database create it for you. This saves you headaches and is very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexes for Great Speed\n",
    "The above `person` table will work great for a simple application. However, if you end up getting millions of `person` records and often lookup people by `name`, you'll notice things will being to get slow. When searching for data, a database will use indexes to find records. Primary keys are indexes by definition, so any lookups by id will be near-instant. However, when there are lookups for fields that don't have an index, the database will have to scan all of the data in the entire table to try and find the right records. This is can make your life a nightmare if not handled correctly. This is why we're covering before we even learn how to lookup data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how we would define this table if we knew we'd be looking up records by the `name` field:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table person (\n",
    "    id int auto_increment,\n",
    "    name varchar(255),\n",
    "    is_admin boolean,\n",
    "    primary key (id),\n",
    "    index person_index_name (name)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create the table with an index on the `name` column. The text `person_index_name` is the name of the index, which must be unique throughout the whole database. To this end, I prefer to use `<table>_<index type>_<column>` as my index names, to prevent name collisions. This is a simple index, so I just use `index`. We'll cover other types later. Using this table definition, any lookups by `name` will also be near-instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why don't we just define indexes for every column? Again, speed. For each index you add to a table, create or updating data in that table gets slowed down. You don't want to overload tables with indexes. You should make sure to figure out how you'll access your tables in advance and plan your indexes accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In additional to simple indexes, there are unique indexes, which will enforce that each record of data has a unique value. Here's an example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table person (\n",
    "    id int auto_increment,\n",
    "    name varchar(255),\n",
    "    is_admin boolean,\n",
    "    primary key (id),\n",
    "    unique index person_index_name (name)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create an index just like above, but it will also enforce that each record's `name` field is unique. If there's an attempt to create a new record with the same `name`, the database will spit out an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partitions, Also Speed\n",
    "Partitions are also something that needs to be considered up front. Traditionally, databases would store table data in one file on the disk. When the file gets really huge, efficiency can degrade very quickly. To solve this, the idea of partitions was created. Partitions are rules by which the database should split up tables into multiple files. Akin to indexes, this requires a balance. Having tons of tiny partitions will cause the database to open tons of files unnecessarily, while keeping your partitions too large can make finding data slower. \n",
    "\n",
    "Partitions are really complicated and vary on a case-by-case basis. I've mostly only used partitioning on time-series data, that is, data primarily organized by time. For example, if I have a table like below:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table server_status_report (\n",
    "    create_timestamp timestamp,\n",
    "    server_id int,\n",
    "    is_alive boolean,\n",
    "    count_requests int\n",
    "    primary key (create_timestamp, server_id)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's highly likely that this table would become _huge_, especially if I have a large number of servers and am receiving status reports every minute. The structure of this table is highly conducive to partitioning. I care about data specifically by time, and the table will grow to be very large. Let's take a stab at partitioning this.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table server_status_report (\n",
    "    create_timestamp timestamp,\n",
    "    server_id int,\n",
    "    is_alive boolean,\n",
    "    count_requests int\n",
    "    primary key (create_timestamp, server_id)\n",
    ") partition by hash (DATE(create_timestamp))\n",
    "partitions 30;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would partition the table into 30 partitions by date, meaning we'd have 30 files representing this table, each file containing 1 day's worth of data. Be aware that __this specific example is very naive__. You'll want to read up on partitioning in greater detail specific to your use case. You'll also likely need some sort of maintenance system to manage your partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note on Table Management\n",
    "You should have some degree of familiarity with these things, but ideally, your organization should have data engineers to manage these things for you. Data engineers specialize in acquiring, storing, and managing data. Things like partitioning should be under their purview, but responsibilities will always vary across organizations. If your organization does have dedicated data engineers, you should make sure to build a strong relationship with them as quickly as you can. Ensuring that data setup in a manner that makes your job easy is critical to your success. Be friends with your data engineers. Make them want to make your life easier. Your job is to derive insights from data, not muck around with how exactly it sits on a disk; however, some base knowledge of these topics will help you communicate with your data engineers and garner you some respective for having knowledge in their craft.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Design\n",
    "Now you know how to create tables and design individual tables with at least some degree of effiency, but how do you define multiple tables in a way that makes sense? Why is it called a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema design should follow the concepts of [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization). Normalization is the idea of splitting up data in a manner where repetition is reduced, and therefore data storage and maintenance are reduced. To make things work, database queries will join tables together to assemble the data needed. Be aware that application databases will often high a pretty high amount of normalization. The way applications access data makes splitting out data a good thing. However, data warehouses normally have __de__normalized data. They will intentionally duplicate data in order to eliminate the need for joining tables. When operating at huge scales, table joins can be costly.\n",
