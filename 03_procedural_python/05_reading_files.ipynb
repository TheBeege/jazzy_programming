Streaming data could be something like a file or a network connection to some other data. The `with` indicates that we're opening a stream, and the indented block beneath it should be executed while the stream (file) is open. When the indentation stops, the stream (file) will be closed an inaccessible. This is useful because the operating system may put a lock on the file while it's open, preventing other programs from accessing it. Additionally, having files open costs some amount of resources, so you want to make sure to reclaim the resources spent opening the file as quickly as possible. The `with` construct just makes it easier. It does all the closing and checking for you.\n",

When you iterate over a file like it was a collection, Python does some smart stuff for you. It treats each line like an item in a collection. You'll notice the output may look a little weird. Python is adding a newline character at the end, and this is shown when you print it. Regardless, this is a good way to get data out of a file when you want to work line by line.
