    "Okay, now why did dividing give us `6.0` instead of `6`? This is due to the concept of data types. Python tries to make things such that you don't need to worry about data types, but there really is no escaping it. Initially, `x` is an integer - a whole number. However, the division operation does not produce an integer. It produces a floating point number, or a decimal. Normally, I'd skip what floating point means, but if you're doing number crunching, it's important to know. Let's say we have a number like this: `436,312,683,904,124,673`. Big number. The computer doesn't have unlimited data. It has limited amounts of data it can store, and it wants to be efficient. Representing that number in binary would be quite large. Similar to laboratory sciences, we use approximations. In lab science, we might represent this number as `4.36312 x 10^16`. We cut off the remaining numbers because they're not significant with respect to the size of this number. Computers do similar things. A computer only wants to use so much data to represent numbers, so it will only store the most significant digits and a reference of where the decimal (or point) is located. In this method, the point can float or move around depending on the size of the number. Hence, we call this a floating point number. This is the default way to represent decimals in Python. Since division may not return a whole number, it outputs a floating point in all cases for purposes of consistency. Other mathematical operations return the same data type as whatever was input. The reason for this is that your code likely doesn't expect data to change type terribly often. Division is kind of a special case in this regard.\n",

    "The last thing to cover is comments. Comments are text within your code files that isn't run. This is useful for temporarily disabling code or for adding notes within your code. With Jupyter, you may think that comments may not be necessary, but there are cases where you would want some body of code to be in continuous block, run as an atomic unit, rather than split up into smaller code blocks. To write a comment, just toss a `#` before the code you don't want executed. Everything after the `#` on that line will be ignored by Python."
