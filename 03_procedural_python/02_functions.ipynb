    "This is a pretty useless function, but it's a good start. This is called a function definition. It's important to know the difference between a function definition and a function invokation (or execution). We'll cover the difference shortly. Just know that this is a definition. The giveaway is the `def` part. Following `def`, you write the name of the function. Ideally, you want to make your function name as descriptive as possible without being overly verbose. Commonly, Python programmers use underscores `_` to separate words. Following the function name is a set of parenthesis. Optionally, arguments are defined within these parenthesis. We'll show that in a moment. After the parenthesis comes a colon `:`. Up to and including this point is called the function signature. Less important, but still good to know. After the colon, the function body starts. The body consists of the code that will be executed whenever this function is invoked. Let's try it, then I'll explain."

This is what we've been doing anytime we run the print function. Something to note in the function definition, all code within the body must be indented! Python uses indentation whitespace to know what code belongs to what other code. This way, the hello there print statement is inside the function, while saying that we're going to run the function is not inside the function. The only difference is the indentation. You'll see more of this later."
