    "Let's unpack this. In this example, instead of using a `range` function for our collection, we have something called a tuple. A tuple is a group of values in some order, and it is immutable - it cannot be changed. To create a tuple, just surround some values with parenthesis `()` separated by commas `,`. In this example, `i` will first be set to 9, then the loop's block will be executed. Next, `i` will be set to 3, and the block will execute again. This finishes with 11, after which point the loop stops, and the program continues going down. One key thing about a tuple is that it cannot be changed. Why is this useful? It's a way to communicate with the developer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example. Say you're writing a database library. To change data in the database, you need to connect to the database, send a request for the data you want to get, receive the response, parse the response, and format it in a way to be used. To change the data in the database requires a similar level of effort. When you give data to the programmer from the database, you probably want to give them a tuple. This is because you want to communicate to the developer that simply changing the data in this collection will not change what's in the database. You have to go through some large operation to do that. By preventing the developer from changing the data you give them, you communicate this very clearly, forcing them to do the extra work if they want to change the value in the database. \n",

The `items()` method actually returns a tuple each time it's called. The first item in that tuple is the key, and the second item in that tuple is the value. Effectively, we're doing multiple assignments when doing the aboves. You can set multiple variables at the same time from a collection. This is called unpacking. Let's demonstrate in a standalone way"
