# Setting Up
Before we dive into things, there are some general tools that you'll want to install to make life easier for you in the future. Let's get it done.

## XCode Utilities
Many things depend on common packages like the GCC compiler, which is used for compiling C programs. If that sounds like Greek to you, don't worry about it. Just know that you need it. These common packages are easily downloaded and installed using XCode. Rather than repeat things, you can find a quick run-through here: http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html

## Homebrew
Homebrew is a package manager for dev tools on Mac. [The Homebrew webpage has a single-line install command.](https://brew.sh/) Run that, and you should be all set!
